# This repository mantains an introduction to testing using Jest as a test runner and assertion library and @testing-library for rendering and interaction with the DOM.

This project is based on the rules for the pokemon trading card game, and can be checked at the current project folder

# How to run it
Inside package.json there are some scripts for each concept. Take a look there

To execute all tests:

```yarn test```

To execute all tests with coverage:

```yarn test:coverage```

### PRO TIP: When working with coverage install this extension on VSCode [Coverage Gutters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters)
It will register a command on vscode 'Coverage Gutter: Display Coverage' (or watch for always display coverage), and will show you the coverage on all files.

# TODO

- More complex react testing
- Something about coverage
