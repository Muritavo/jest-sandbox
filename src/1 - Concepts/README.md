# Here we examplify 2 types of tests

## Inside this folder you will find the folders:
- **src**: with the implementation of the modules to be tested
- **test**: With the tests for some of the modules. The tests are separated in two suites:
    - Unit tests: Where the code to be tested is isolated from it's dependencies and tested as a single unit
    - Integration tests: Where the dependencies are allowed and the test is executed based on scenarios.
